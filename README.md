### Introduction

#### Transcript
So looks like we've established how to get going on the AWS Cloud, but what if you have existing deployments in on-premises environments or have started a cloud journey without AWS? Well, we'd love to help you move across, especially since you can take advantage of some real savings by moving. 

This brings us to migration and innovation. We'll show you all the options from migration tools, the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework, and even the Snow Family, which are physical devices to migrate data in and out of AWS. 

So before we adjourn, stay glued to your seats for information on how to move from on-premises environment or the cloud to AWS. We'll even cover the six Rs of migration.

### AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)

Different team members bring different perspectives (finance, business, operations, development, etc.).

Migrating to the cloud is a process. You don't just snap your fingers and have everything magically hosted in AWS. It takes a lot of effort to get applications migrated to AWS, and having a successful cloud migration is something that requires expertise. 

Luckily, many people have had successful cloud migrations in the past, and you're not the first one to have solutions in AWS. Because of this, a lot of the knowledge around how to go about hosting on AWS has been captured and shared. 

That being said, what position you hold in your organization will impact the things that you need to know or help with for your migration. If you are a developer, your role and viewpoint will be much different than a cloud architect, business analyst or financial analyst. Different types of people bring different perspectives to the table for migration, and you want to harness those different perspectives and make sure everyone is on the same page. 

You also want to ensure that you have the right talent to help support your migration, so HR will need to hire at the correct rate to enable your migration. This can be a lot to keep track of, and someone new to the cloud might not think of all the different people who need to be involved. 

The AWS professional services team has created something called the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework that can help you manage this process through guidance. The Cloud Adoption Framework exists to provide advice to your company to enable a quick and smooth migration to AWS. 

The framework organizes guidance into six areas focused on the different types of people that you'll need to involve for your migration. Just like the different perspectives that we talked about earlier. Each Perspective covers distinct responsibilities covered by different groups. The different Perspectives are Business, People, and Governance Perspectives, which focus on the business capabilities, and then you have the Platform, Security and Operations Perspectives which focus on the technical capabilities. Someone who is a business or finance analysts would fall under the Business Perspective, HR would fall under the People Perspective, and a cloud architect would fall under the Platform Perspective.
 
Each Perspective is used to uncover gaps in your skills and processes, which are then recorded as inputs. These inputs are then used as the basis for creating what is called an AWS Cloud Adoption Framework Action Plan that you then use to guide your organization's change management as you journey to the cloud. Having an action plan that makes sense for your organization can help keep you on track. 

Migrating to the cloud can be complicated, but again, you're not alone in this, there are tons of resources to help you get started, and the Cloud Adoption Framework is a great place to look.
